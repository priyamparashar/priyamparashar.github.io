*Summary*: Robbie and Gloria are born and brought up in Gracetown, Florida. Gracetown is a place of horrors and Robbie and Gloria both are touched by it and have ability to see ghosts and intuit futures. Robbie gets sent to *the Reformatory* when he kicks the knee of an affluent white boy, who also happens to be his neighbor making advances on his sister, and is clearly in need of "fixing". Gloria, his sister, is on the outside seeing the injustice of what is happening and trying her best to save her brother. Save from what? *The Reformatory* bills itself and acts like a high school but is actually a place of torture and heinous crimes against young boys, specially if you were black. They are fathered by Robert Stephens, a known black local leader, which further complicates their position inside and outside. Then there are the haints of Reformatory to contend with. An emotional, horror-fantasy novel awaits.

*Rating*: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This is a fast-paced, horror-fantasy book with an emotional and urgent undercurrent running through its length. Number 1, this is mild-to-medium horror but done so well. There is tension and release, and a sweetness that comes from it being a story centered on a 12 and a 16 year old. I never felt scared of the paranormal but there is plenty to be scared of with the racist humans. There were multiple places in this book that I had to close my eyes tight and breathe deep hoping things don't go the way I fear they will. I genuinely love this place of horror that diverse authors have created out of lore, culture, society and actual horror. I am thinking Stephen Graham Jones, Cassandra Khaw, and, now, Tananarive Due. On TV, I have always found serial killer, any slasher to be infinitely scarier than horror genre movies and these books are doing something new here which is fresh and speaks to my brown person perspective of the world. I also loved how this book talks about ancestors and how their spirits look out for you.

*Characters*: Every character in this book is developed so well, even the antagonist and the antagonist adjacents. Gloria is a stoic 16 year old who is just young enough to fight against injustice when she sees it. She is just old enough to understand the glint of disgust in this world while still being young and naive at other times. I felt for her and she was just so real. Robbie, my other favorite character, was like a coin flip: terrified or gleeful in his 12 year old brain. Together these characters make someone you root for and thus bring real gravity to the tense situations. Haddock is rightly despicable, but I have a special place of hatred for Boone. I don't know why I feel that way but I do.

> [!note] Gloria the Stoic
>  One thing that I am stuck on is the "silently simmering" treatment of Gloria. A lot of books, TV and movies with a strong girl character usually have them simmering in the background or the foreground with hardly any other emotion. Gloria on the surface is similar here, but she has such a rich internal life in this book that it makes sense why is she the way she is shown/written. There is the weight of the world put upon her and then the weight of the world she sees on the flip and takes responsibility for. 

Well written, well paced piece of literature. It has the paranormal horror then it has the horror of the world tied up with it. 100% give it a read.

> Apparently Tananarive's mom had a cousin named Robert Stephens at the Dozier School for Boys in Floria who died there at the age of 15. This is her way of rewriting his story as fiction while intertwining what she could. Recommend giving the podcast a listen once you've read this book. I will 100% be reading more from her.
