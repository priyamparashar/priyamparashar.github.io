Welcome to my homepage. I write about tech, science, art, books, philosophy and any other thing that I have been thinking about.

## About Me

Currently I am a roboticist working with FAIR, Meta.

Research topics I think about a lot:
- How to use LLMs for long-horizon planning problems which require visual input but also retrieval?
- How to model and code persistent geometric/3D/episodic memory structures for retrieval?

Previously I did my Ph.D. at UC San Diego under Dr. Henrik I. Christensen and Dr. Ashok K. Goel (Georgia Tech). I have spent my time at UC San Diego, Georgia Tech, CMU and IIIT Hyderabad making friends and meeting seriously amazing people.
